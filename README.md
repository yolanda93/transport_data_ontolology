# Development of an ontology and a knowledge base for public transport data


The objective of this hands-on activity, which must be done individually, is the development of a well-documented ontology model in the area of public transport data, which should allow generating a large worldwide knowledge base about public transport. Therefore, the ontology must include classes related to the public transport infrastructure (e.g., bus, metro, train, tram stops), and about the public transport services (e.g., lines, schedules, connections between lines). Attention must be paid to existing models for public transport data representation (e.g., GTFS, data available in open data portals of cities and regions) as a source of inspiration for the development and documentation of such ontology, as well as to ontology design patterns.

Furthermore, an RDF knowledge base should be generated according to this ontology. This can be done providing a sample knowledge base created manually (e.g., some sample data from Madrid's transport network) or by processing any of the transport data available in Web information sources or open data portals anywhere in the world. Real-time services like those provided in the open data portal of EMT Madrid (the public bus company inside Madrid) may be used as well.

Students will have to submit a PDF file containing a short document (no more than 5 pages) describing the main design decisions on the development of the ontology and the knowledge base, as well as links to the developed OWL ontology (e.g., it may be a GitHub repository or alike), to the knowledge base in RDF, and optionally to the source code used to generate such knowledge base.
